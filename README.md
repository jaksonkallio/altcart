# altcart
A cryptocurrency shopping cart and checkout software.

## Accept Cryptocurrencies Easily
Use simple commands like `getProductInfo(id)` or `startCheckout()` to set up your fully functioning checkout system that accepts cryptocurrencies directly without 3rd party apps or accounts.

## How do I start?
There are two components to this project.
* Back-end cart software
* (optional) Front-end theme/demo

### Back-end Usage
1. Download/clone the git repository.
2. Copy the `altcart` folder from the git repo root into your project.
3. `require_once(../location/of/altcart/use-altcart.php)` at the top of the files you wish to use altcart on.
4. Customize `altcart/config.php` to your shop specifications.

That's it!
